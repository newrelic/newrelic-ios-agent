# This purpose of this GitHub action is to automate uploading the main agent test app to LamdbaTest. LambdaTest has a retention policy of 60 days. This automation ensures that the app is always available for testing without manual intervention and will always be providing data to the following entities without interruption:

# main-agent-test-app-ios: https://staging.onenr.io/07jbMl8KnRy

# This action triggers a node.js function that uploads the app to LambdaTest.
# The function uses a `custom_id` to identify that app with a specific name rather than the default names provided upon upload, which will change per upload.
