/*
 * This class manages the upload and retry of binary data to the specified endpoint
 * It is currently used in tandem with the HexUploadPublisher, which is a C++ class passed to the libMobileAgent to
 * manage Hex Report publication.
 *
 * This is the simpler version of the hex uploader (contrasting the NRMAHexBackgroundUploader) and only manages upload
 * data in memory. This means if the app catastrophically fails the last minute worth of Hex reports will be lost.
 * It is intended to replace this uploader variant with one that saves reports to disk to protect against that loss.
 *
 * To replace this object in use look to the HExUploadPublisher where this NRMAHexUploader is injected as a PIMPL
 * object.
